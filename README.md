KDRM is a backdoor P.O.C panel for Garry's Mod it should never be used on a actual production system and still contains important bugs that makes some features unusable.
This is purely made to continue Kermini (the predecessor) and represents what a modern backdoor panel would have been capable of.

The name was initially purely made to confuse people with the real panel's purpose, and the "K" just stands for kermini.

Contribution to this project is welcome, but this is not considered as an active project and a major bug renders the lasts versions unusable for some reason (starting the route split in admin.php and web.php)

The major features include:
✅ 🕸️ Account System

✅ ⭐ Admin System with mod actions

✅ 📜 Logs System

✅ 💻 Backdoor and server handling

✅ 💀 LUA Payloads

🟠 🛡️ IP Blocker (Block ips and ip range from servers and people connecting to the panel globally and per account)

🔴 🔎 More Search bars (Intended as an update to make navigation easier and a big standalone feature)
